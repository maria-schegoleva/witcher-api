      "description": " A silver sword is one of the two main tools of the witcher. It is a delicate blade only used against creatures who are vulnerable to silver, such as the undead and most types of monsters. It is light enough to be wielded in only one hand, leaving the other hand free for another weapon or for the casting of Signs."

      "description": " Simple people call the basilisk the king of the Zerrikanian deserts and often mistake it for a cockatrice. They claim that the beast is filled with such hatred towards all living things that even its breath is venomous and its glance turns the unwary to stone. The fact that witchers often encounter basilisks in dungeons and cellars contradicts the legend and suggests these creatures can reproduce under any conditions like many of their nasty monster brethren. In fairy tales, the only certain way to kill a basilisk is by holding a mirror in front of its eyes to divert its deadly gaze. Witchers reply that it is far better to smash the mirror on the creature's head."
